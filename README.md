The purpose of this repository is to give you more transparency about future features, and to give you space to voice your opinion.

## Bugs and Feature requests
Feel free to open a feature/bug issue via the [issues panel](https://github.com/WPDreams/ajax-search-pro-development/issues/new/choose).

Please follow the template to describe the issue or feature. We are more than happy to consider any feature, but of course it is not always possible to add everything. On the other hand bugs are prioritized always, and usually fixed within the next release.

If an issue is considered, then it is assigned a branch so you can track the commits related to it. To see all commits, you can join the [SLACK channel](https://join.slack.com/t/ernestmarcinko/shared_invite/zt-24i3vq4zm-5foeqK_sa4Jik1xReJmxJA). Obviously the main repository is private, but you will still be able to see the commit messages and other details.
